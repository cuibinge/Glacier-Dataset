# Polar Glacier Bitemporal Remote Sensing Dataset

## Dataset Overview

This dataset contains bitemporal remote sensing images from two representative polar regions:

**Southeastern Coast of Greenland**  
(Latitude 64Â°â€“66Â°N, Longitude 51Â°â€“56Â°W): Dominated by glaciers and icefields, this area features exposed bedrock mountains and narrow coastal vegetation zones. It is a key region for studying glacier dynamics, with typical crevasse systems on the glacier surface and primitive vegetation emerging in coastal areas following glacier retreat.

**Svalbard Archipelago**  
(Latitude 74Â°â€“81Â°N, Longitude 10Â°â€“35Â°E): Approximately 60% of this region is covered by glaciers, while the remainder consists of exposed land and Arctic tundra vegetation. It includes various glacier types such as ice caps, valley glaciers, and icefields, making it an ideal site for studying glacierâ€“permafrost interactions in the Arctic.

## Data Construction and Patch Sampling

In our study, the original satellite imagery acquired from Landsat-8 covered a region measuring 8541 Ã— 8601 pixels, with a spatial resolution of 30 meters. To focus on glacier-dominated areas, the images were filtered and cropped, resulting in a subregion of 5109 Ã— 4801 pixels. For the construction of glacier change detection samples, we applied a sliding window approach with a stride of 128 pixels to extract image patches of size 256 Ã— 256 pixels from the cropped area. This process yielded a total of 683 bitemporal image pairs, which were used in our dataset.

The choice of a 256 Ã— 256 resolution strikes a balance between capturing sufficient spatial detail for effective glacier change detection and maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, the patch size ensures that each sample contains relevant information from both pre- and post-event imagery, enabling accurate change analysis without incurring excessive computational cost.
